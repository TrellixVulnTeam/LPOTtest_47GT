LPOT UX
=======

## Start the UX

1. Start the LPOT UX server:

   ```shell
   lpot_ux
   ```
2. The server prints information on how to access the Web UI.

   An example message looks like this: 

   ```text
   LPOT UX Server started.
   Setup port forwarding from your local port 5000 to 5000 on this machine.
   Then open address http://localhost:5000/?token=338174d13706855fc6924cec7b3a8ae8
   ```

   Make certain that requested port forwarding is set up (depending on your OS) and then open the address in your web browser.

## My Models list

This view lists all Model Configurations defined on a given server. 

You can create a new model using pre-defined models by using a New Model Wizard or **Examples**:

![My models list](imgs/ux/my_models.png "My models list")

## New Model Configuration from New Model Wizard
### Basic parameters

1. If all related files are located in one directory, point your Workspace there.
   
   Click the ![Change Current Workspace Button](imgs/ux/workspace_change.png "Change")
   button (on the top-left part of UX) and navigate to the desired directory. Click **Choose** to confirm your selection.

2. Open the Wizard by clicking the ![Create low precision model button image](imgs/ux/model_create_new.png "Create low precision model") button.

3. Enter information in all required fields (marked by a *) in the Wizard: 
   ![Basic parameters wizard](imgs/ux/wizard_basic.png "Basic parameters")

4. Either save this configuration (by clicking **Save**), or change some advanced parameters (by clicking **Next**).

### Advanced parameters

From the advanced parameters page, you can configure more features such as tuning, quantization, and benchmarking. 

![Advanced parameters wizard](imgs/ux/wizard_advanced.png "Advanced parameters")

## New Model Configuration from Examples

![Examples](imgs/ux/examples.png "Examples")

Included are models you can use to test tuning. Visit **Examples** to:

* Download a model to a selected Workspace.
* Download a predefined configuration file for models.

When both models and configurations are downloaded, you can point to the Dataset to be used and then click **Add to my models**. A new model will be added to the **My models** list, ready for tuning.

## Custom dataset or metric

If you choose "custom" in Dataset or Metric section, appropriate code template will be generated for you to fill in with your code.

Path to the template will be available by clicking "Copy code template path" button in right-most column in My models list.

Follow the comments in generated code template to fill in required methods with your own code.

## Tuning

Having a Model Configuration created, you can do the following:

* See the generated config (by clicking the "Show config" link).
* Start the tuning:
  * Click the blue arrow ![Start Tuning button](imgs/ux/tuning_start.png "Start tuning") to start the tuning.
  * Click **Show output** to see logs that are generated during tuning.
  * Your model will be tuned according to configuration.
  * When the tuning is finished, you will see accuracy results in the **My Models** list:
      - The **Accuracy** section displays comparisons in accuracy metrics between the original and tuned models.
      - **Model size** compares the sizes of both models.
      - When automatic benchmarking is finished, **Throughput** shows the performance gain from tuning. 

## Advanced options
### TLS connection encryption

You can provide your own certificate and key to the server in order to use TLS-encrypted communication between the UI and the server.

Add two parameters to the server start command:

```
lpot_ux --certfile path_to_cert.crt --keyfile path_to_private_key.key
```
